"""Binding an analysis task to whoever started it.

``/api/status/<task_id>/`` is ``AllowAny`` and returns the Celery task's whole
return value. For ``analyze_resume_task`` that value contains ``resume_text`` —
the full extracted document — so the task id was a bearer credential for
someone else's resume, and nothing in the code treated it as one. It is handed
to the browser, then put in a **URL path**, which means it also ends up in
access logs, proxy logs, ``Referer`` headers and browser history, and it stays
redeemable until Celery's result backend drops the row.

This module issues a separate, deliberate credential instead.

Why not just require authentication
-----------------------------------
That would close the anonymous hole and leave the cross-user one: ``upload_resume``
is ``AllowAny`` by design, so anonymous analyses are a supported flow, and a
signed-in user B could still redeem user A's id. Ownership has to be recorded,
not inferred from "is anybody logged in".

Why a signed token rather than a server-side record
---------------------------------------------------
A record needs somewhere to live. ``django.core.cache`` is the obvious place and
the wrong one here: the project has no ``CACHES`` configured, so it is
``LocMemCache`` — per process. Behind two gunicorn workers, roughly half of a
user's own polls would be refused. Sessions are no better for this: anonymous
uploads are cross-origin and the frontend does not send credentials, so there is
no cookie to key on.

``django.core.signing`` needs no shared state at all. The claim carries its own
payload and is verified against ``SECRET_KEY``, so every worker reaches the same
answer and there is nothing to expire, evict or replicate.

What the claim actually proves
------------------------------
Two things, and it is worth being precise about which:

* **For a signed-in user** — that the holder is *that user*. The claim names the
  user id and :func:`verify_claim` re-derives the caller's identity from the
  request, so a leaked claim is useless to anyone else.
* **For an anonymous upload** — only that the holder started *this* task. There
  is no identity to bind to. That is not a weakening: it is what the task id was
  already doing, except the claim is issued for the purpose, travels in a header
  rather than a URL path, and expires on a clock we choose.
