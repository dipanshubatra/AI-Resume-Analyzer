"""Which skills a career track requires, and which store answers that question.

There are two stores, and until now the one nobody can edit won.

``services.EXPERIENCE_LEVEL_SKILLS`` is a dictionary in a Python module.
``Role`` / ``Skill`` are tables, seeded by migration ``0012_populate_role_skills``
and kept fresh by cache-invalidating signals in ``models.py``. The resolver
looked at the dictionary first:

.. code-block:: python

    level_dict = EXPERIENCE_LEVEL_SKILLS.get(norm_level, {})
    if target_role in level_dict:
        return level_dict[target_role]          # <- database never consulted
    return get_role_skills().get(target_role, [])

For the only three roles the product ships — Frontend Developer, Backend
Developer, Data Analyst — the dictionary always matched, so the database branch
was dead code. Editing a ``Role``'s skills changed nothing: the m2m signal
cleared the cache correctly, ``get_role_skills()`` re-read the table correctly,
and the result was discarded one line later.

That matters now rather than in the abstract, because #545 and #546 both propose
an admin UI over exactly those tables. Built on the old resolver, that UI would
be a no-op for every role a user can pick.

The obvious fix is wrong
------------------------
"Read the database first, fall back to the packaged defaults" loses experience
levels. The ``Role`` table has **no level column** — it holds one skill list per
role — and ``0012`` seeded it with the *Mid-Level* lists. So a database-first
resolver answers the Mid-Level set at every level, and a Junior resume is
suddenly measured against Senior requirements. The existing
``ExperienceLevelTests`` catch exactly that, which is how I found it.

What actually holds
-------------------
The two stores answer different questions, and neither is redundant:

* the **database** says *which skills this role needs* — the thing an operator
  edits, and the thing that was being ignored;
* the packaged **level tiers** say *how a role's requirements move with
  seniority* — expressed nowhere in the schema, and not something an operator
  can currently state.

So a level is treated as a **delta from Mid-Level**, derived from the packaged
data rather than hand-maintained:

.. code-block:: text

    added   = EXPERIENCE_LEVEL_SKILLS[level][role] - EXPERIENCE_LEVEL_SKILLS["Mid-Level"][role]
    removed = EXPERIENCE_LEVEL_SKILLS["Mid-Level"][role] - EXPERIENCE_LEVEL_SKILLS[level][role]

and the result is ``(baseline - removed) | added``, where ``baseline`` is the
database's list when it has the role and the packaged Mid-Level list otherwise.

Two properties fall out of that, and both are tested:

1. On an untouched install the baseline *is* the Mid-Level list, so every level
   resolves to exactly the packaged list it always did. Nothing moves.
2. An operator who adds ``rust`` to Backend Developer gets it at all three
   levels, because it appears in no level's ``removed`` set — and one who
   removes ``webpack`` loses it at all three, for the same reason.

The limitation this leaves
--------------------------
An operator still cannot say "Docker, but only from Senior". That needs a level
dimension on ``Role``, which is a schema change and belongs with the admin UI
work in #545/#546 rather than in a bug fix. Naming it here so the next person
does not read the delta machinery as the intended end state.
