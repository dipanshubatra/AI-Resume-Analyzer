"""Multi-factor ATS scoring.

The headline ``score`` on an analysis is a single division — matched role
keywords over required ones. That makes a keyword-stuffed page with no work
history, no contact details and no measurable achievements score 100, and it
gives the user nothing to act on beyond "add more keywords".

This module scores a resume across the things an ATS and a recruiter actually
look at, and reports each factor separately so the UI can explain where the
points went. Signals the pipeline already computes — readability from
``textstat``, unquantified bullets from ``quantify_checker`` — are passed in
rather than recomputed.

The weights below sum to 100. Keyword match stays the single largest factor
because it is what actually gets a resume past a filter; the rest are the
difference between passing the filter and being worth reading afterwards.
