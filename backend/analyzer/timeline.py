"""Reading the employment timeline out of a resume.

Everything the analyzer produces today is about *what* a resume says — skills,
keyword coverage, readability, whether bullets carry numbers. Nothing looks at
*when*. A resume can score 90 here and still be filtered on its dates, because
recruiters read the dates before the bullets and ATS platforms parse them into
structured employment records.

This module finds date ranges in the extracted text, sorts them, and reports
what a person reading the timeline would notice: undated roles, gaps, overlaps,
reversed ranges, dates in the future, and inconsistent formats. It also derives
total experience as the *union* of the ranges, so two concurrent roles are not
counted twice, and compares that against the experience level the user selected.

Being conservative is the design
--------------------------------
The layout is gone by the time we see this text. ``pdfplumber`` gives a stream
of lines with no idea which line is a job title and which is a bullet, so this
cannot know that "Acme Corp" and "Jan 2020 – Mar 2022" belong together — only
that they are near each other.

So the rule throughout is: **report what is confident, say nothing where it is
not.** In particular, an undated entry is only ever flagged when the resume has
*some* dated entries to compare against. A resume we simply failed to parse must
produce silence, not a page of warnings — a false "you forgot your dates" on a
resume that has them is worse than missing a real one, because it sends the user
looking for a problem that does not exist.

The findings are deliberately **not** folded into the headline ``score``. That
number is persisted on ``ResumeAnalysis`` and read by the leaderboard, version
comparison and the weekly digest, so changing what it means would change every
historical row — the same reasoning ``scoring.compute_score_breakdown`` already
gives for staying out of it.
